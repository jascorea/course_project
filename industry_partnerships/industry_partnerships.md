# UNCC Computer Vision Industry Partnerships

As part of Computer Vision (ITCS 4152/5152), students will work on a [semester-long group project](https://github.com/unccv/course_project), where they will build a demo solution to a real computer vision problem. Where possible, group projects will involve working directly with a local business or startup. Industry partners will select computer vision "side problems" or ideas that they find interesting but don't have time to explore, but could be relevant to their business one day. [Here are some example topics.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ihH5_DdFyn5M0yv9maoYeqpiFoL4fL5jLYOeC4IgN0s/edit#gid=0) Ideally, industry partners will meet with student groups 2-3 times throughout the semester to provide feedback + direction. When possible, partners may provide data for students to use.

## Benefits to Industry Partners
- Groups may come up with interesting approaches that may be worth pursuing further
- Partners may identify well-qualified potential interns or hires

## Benefits to Students
- Get work on a real problem
- A little guidance along the way
- Exposure to interesting places to potentially work
- A strong resume booster

## Timeframe for Fall 2018

### Topic Selection
- Prior to September 1
- Industry Partners will choose 1-3 interesting "side problems" for teams to potentially work on, and choose the number of teams they would like to work with (1-2 would be ideal).

### Meeting 1: Customer Research
- Between September 15 and September 30
- Meeting location + times will be coordinated between teams and partners
- Teams will be conducting customer research, this is their chance to learn about your problem. 

### Meeting 2: Literature Review
- Between October 15 and October 30
- Meeting location + times will be coordinated between teams and partners
- Teams will present a review of relevant academic literature, publically available data, tools, and code; and existing industry solutions. Findings will be shared in a short slide deck and short write up.

### Meeting 3: Final Presentation
- Between Dec 1 and Dec 6
- Industry Partners are invited to attend final group presentations at UNCC (date TBD - likely December 3, 4, or 5). If this doesn't work, teams will present twice - once at UNCC final groups presentations, and meet with partners independently for final presentations.
- Teams will share a demo of the solution they have developed, and share key findings form the development process.
